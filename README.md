spring-xd-demo
==============
This is a simple demo, showing Spring XD ingesting data from Twitter, filtering it, and then keeping track of specific field contents via some counters.

The main point of the code here is to document:
- a (reasonably) portable nginx config file, to serve the visualisation dashboard
- the D3 javascript library setup

You can find the D3 javascript library at http://d3js.org/
